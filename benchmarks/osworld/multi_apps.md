## Known Issues & Workarounds

| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|------------|
| LO Document Recovery dialog blocks after crash/kill | `rm -f ~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/.~lock.*` before reopening |
| openpyxl destroys charts when saving xlsx | Use LO Basic macro via `soffice --headless macro:///` |
| openpyxl default sheet name "Sheet" ≠ evaluator "Sheet1" | Always set `ws.title = 'Sheet1'` |
| openpyxl formulas lack `<v>` cached values | Write numeric values, or use LO to re-save |
| pyautogui `typewrite()` triggers Chrome on URL-like text | Use clipboard paste or local edit + upload |
| xdotool not pre-installed on OSWorld VMs | Use pyautogui.typewrite() (always available) |
| pip install on VM times out (HuggingFace SSL errors) | Modify files locally on Mac, upload via base64 |
| Google Drive tasks need OAuth | Requires credentials setup in settings.yml |

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Local Edit + Upload Pattern
Best pattern for modifying VM files:
1. Download from VM via base64
2. Modify locally with openpyxl/python-docx
3. Upload back via base64 chunks
4. Open in LO if formula caching needed

### 2. LO Headless Macro for Sheet Operations
`soffice --headless macro:///Standard.Module1.ReorderSheets` preserves charts and formatting that openpyxl would destroy.

### 3. Evaluator Strictness
- `compare_pptx_files`: Checks ALL shapes including paragraph count
- `compare_docx_tables`: Exact text match per cell
- `check_cell`: Reads raw XML `<v>` tags, not computed values
- `compare_table` with `sheet_print`: Converts xlsx→CSV via libreoffice
