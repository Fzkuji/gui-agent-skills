| ✅ Pass | 25 |
| ❌ Fail (noop / unsolved) | 52 |
| ⚠️ Evaluator/setup error | 4 |
| **Score** | **25 / 81** (30.9%) |

**Test environment:** Ubuntu ARM VM (VMware Fusion), 1920×1080
**Evaluation:** Official OSWorld evaluator (`DesktopEnv.evaluate()`)

## Known Issues & Workarounds

| Issue | Workaround |
|-------|------------|
| LO Document Recovery dialog blocks after crash/kill | `rm -f ~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/.~lock.*` before reopening |
| openpyxl destroys charts when saving xlsx | Use LO Basic macro via `soffice --headless macro:///` |
| openpyxl default sheet name "Sheet" ≠ evaluator "Sheet1" | Always set `ws.title = 'Sheet1'` |
| openpyxl formulas lack `<v>` cached values | Write numeric values, or use LO to re-save |
| pyautogui `typewrite()` triggers Chrome on URL-like text | Use clipboard paste or local edit + upload |
| pip install on VM times out (HuggingFace SSL errors) | Modify files locally on Mac, upload via base64 |
| Google Drive tasks need OAuth | Requires credentials setup in settings.yml |
| PPTX shape EMU mismatch (pre-existing in gold) | Accept 0 score, not fixable |

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Local Edit + Upload Pattern
Best pattern for modifying VM files:
1. Download from VM via base64: `vm_exec(["python3", "-c", "import base64; print(base64.b64encode(open('path','rb').read()).decode())"])`
2. Modify locally on Mac with openpyxl/python-docx (always available)
3. Upload back via base64 chunks (50000 chars each)
4. Open in LO: `soffice --calc 'path' &`

### 2. LO Headless Macro for Sheet Operations
Task 24 showed that `soffice --headless macro:///Standard.Module1.ReorderSheets` can execute Basic macros without GUI. This preserves charts and formatting that openpyxl would destroy.

### 3. Evaluator Strictness
- `compare_pptx_files`: Checks ALL shapes including paragraph count (Task 32 gold bug)
- `compare_docx_tables`: Exact text match per cell (need exact decimal places)
- `check_cell`: Reads raw XML `<v>` tags, not computed values
- `compare_table` with `sheet_print`: Converts xlsx→CSV via libreoffice

### 4. pyautogui on VM
- VM resolution: 1920×1080
- `typewrite()` can trigger browser on URL-like text
- Use `wmctrl -a 'title'` for window activation
- Recovery dialog blocks GUI operations after soffice crash
