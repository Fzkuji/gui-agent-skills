# Core Principles & Lessons Learned

## Tool Priority (fastest → slowest)

| Tool | Speed | Use for |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Template match** | ~0.3s | Known UI elements from memory (conf=1.0) |
| **cliclick** | instant | Mouse clicks (`c:x,y`), keys (`kp:return`) |
| **Apple Vision OCR** | ~1.6s | Find text on screen (Chinese + English) |
| **GPA-GUI-Detector** | ~0.3s | Find icons/buttons (YOLO, 40MB) |
| **Screenshot + Vision** | ~5-10s | Last resort, send to LLM for analysis |

**Rule**: Always try cheaper methods first. Don't run YOLO+OCR if template match works.

## Coordinate System

```
Screen (0,0) ──────────────────────────► x
│
│    Window (win_x, win_y)
│    ┌──────────────────┐
│    │  Component at     │
│    │  relative (rx,ry) │
│    │                   │
│    │  screen_x = win_x + rx
│    │  screen_y = win_y + ry
│    └──────────────────┘
│
▼ y
```

- **All memory stores relative coordinates** (relative to window top-left)
- **Convert to screen coords only at click time**
- **Retina**: screenshots are 2x physical pixels, divide by 2 for logical
- **cliclick uses logical screen pixels**, always integers

## Hard-Won Lessons

### Window Management
- **Don't hide other apps by default** — only hide if click fails (retry strategy)
- **Read-only operations don't need hide** — read_messages, scroll_history just activate
- **Activate app before any operation** — never assume focus
- **Window might have moved** — always get fresh bounds before converting coords
- **CRITICAL: OCR/click must be within target window bounds** — NEVER click coordinates outside the target app's window. OCR results from other visible windows will cause mis-clicks (e.g., sending message to Discord instead of WeChat). Always filter OCR results by window bounds.
- **Known bug**: searching for a contact name may match text in OTHER apps' windows if they're visible behind the target app. FIX: capture ONLY the target window screenshot (screencapture -l), not fullscreen

### Input
- **NEVER use cliclick type for CJK** — use pbcopy + Cmd+V
- **Set LANG=en_US.UTF-8** before paste — CJK garbles without it
- **Click input field before typing** — never assume cursor is in the right place
- **Enter sends in WeChat** — NOT Cmd+Enter

### WeChat Specific
- **Cmd+F opens web search (搜一搜)** — NOT contact search. Use sidebar click or search bar template
- **Re-clicking selected chat does nothing** — click away first, then back
- **Input field placeholder invisible to OCR** — use window_calc positioning
- **Only 4 AX elements** — must use YOLO+OCR for everything
- **Left sidebar icons are gray-on-gray** — only GPA-GUI-Detector can detect them (OmniParser fails)

### Detection
- **GPA-GUI-Detector > OmniParser YOLO** for desktop apps (40MB vs 41MB, same architecture, better training data)
- **Apple Vision OCR > EasyOCR** for Chinese (EasyOCR produces garbled output for Chinese)
- **AX is perfect for Dock/menubar** — don't waste time on CV for those
- **Electron apps (Discord, Cursor) have huge AX trees** — filter by region, don't scan everything

### Status Bar / Menu Bar / Floating Windows
- **Status bar icons**: Use AppleScript `click menu bar item 1 of menu bar 2 of process "AppName"` — NOT screenshot+YOLO
- **Menu items**: Navigate by name: `click menu item "Switch Profile" of menu 1 of ...`
- **Sub-menus**: `click menu item "MESL" of menu 1 of menu item "Switch Profile" of ...`
- **Check active item**: `value of attribute "AXMenuItemMarkChar"` returns checkmark
- **Floating windows/popups**: Appear temporarily — screenshot fast before they disappear, or use AppleScript if available

### Remote Server Management (JupyterLab)
- **nvitop** is usually already running in one of the terminal tabs — don't create new notebooks/terminals unnecessarily, look for existing ones first
- JupyterLab has multiple terminal tabs — check ALL tabs before creating new ones
- To run shell commands in Jupyter Notebook: prefix with `!` (e.g., `!nvidia-smi`)
- IME interferes with `!` prefix — use pbcopy paste instead of typing

### Browser / Web Forms
- **Autocomplete inputs (12306, Google, etc.)**: MUST click dropdown suggestion, typing text alone doesn't count
- **Chinese in browser forms**: System IME interferes. Switch to English input, type pinyin abbreviation, let WEBSITE autocomplete handle it
- **Cmd+V in web forms**: May produce garbled text. Use `cliclick t:pinyin` + website autocomplete instead
- **Date pickers**: Click the calendar UI, don't just type date strings
- **URL parameters**: May fill text visually but NOT trigger selection events. Still need to click dropdown items

### Safety
- **Always verify contact before sending** — OCR the chat header
- **Check click target is within window bounds** — prevents clicking wrong app
- **Confidence threshold 0.7** — don't click if template match is too low
- **Don't impersonate user in private chats** — act as AI, not as the user

### Memory Management
- **NEVER auto-learn from wrong-app clicks** — if OCR matched text in Discord but you were supposed to be in WeChat, that learned template is WRONG. Validate the match is in the correct app window before auto-learning.
- **Minimum template size** — templates smaller than 30×30 pixels are too small and will produce false matches everywhere. Don't save them.
- **Icon filename = content description** — `search_bar.png`, NOT `icon_0_170.png`
- **Dedup before saving** — similarity > 0.92 = duplicate, skip it
- **Auto-cleanup dynamic content** — timestamps, message previews, stickers
- **~20-30 components per page** — if you have 60+, you saved too much junk
- **Memory is per-machine** — gitignored, each machine learns its own UI
- **NEVER commit memory/, detected/, templates/ to git** — contains personal screenshots, chat content, contact names. If accidentally committed, use `git filter-branch` to purge from ALL history, then force push


| App | AX Elements | Framework | Notes |
|-----|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Discord | ~1900 | Electron/Chromium | Full AX, sidebar servers have names |
| Chrome | ~1400 | Chromium | Full AX |
| System Settings | ~500 | SwiftUI/AppKit | Full AX, native best |
| Outlook | Very many | Electron | Full AX but slow to scan |
| Cursor | Very many | Electron (VS Code) | Full AX but slow to scan |
| **WeChat** | **4** | Custom engine | Only window buttons, need YOLO+OCR |
| Telegram | Unknown | Custom | Needs testing |
| Dock | Full | System | Always has names + positions |
| Menu bar | Full | System | Always has names + positions |
| Status bar | Full | System | Each app's tray icon accessible |
